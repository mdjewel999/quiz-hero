                    The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method
                    returns undefined and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the
                    same job, the returning value remains different. <br>

                    <strong>map: </strong> The map method creates a new array by applying a callback function to each
                    element of the
                    original array. The callback function returns a new value that will be used as the corresponding
                    element in the new array. <br>

                    <strong>filter: </strong>The filter method creates a new array with all the elements from the
                    original array that
                    satisfy a condition specified by a callback function. The callback function must return a boolean
                    value indicating whether the element should be included in the new array. <br>

                    <strong>forEach: </strong>The forEach method simply iterates over each element of the array and
                    applies a callback
                    function to it. It does not create a new array, nor does it modify the original array. <br>

                    <strong> find: </strong>The find method returns the first element of the array that satisfies a
                    condition specified by
                    a callback function. The callback function must return a boolean value indicating whether the
                    element satisfies the condition. <br>

                    <strong>In summary,</strong> map and filter create new arrays, forEach simply iterates over the
                    array, and find
                    returns the first element that satisfies a condition.

                    LocalStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are all client-side storage mechanisms in web development,
                    but they differ in their scope, capacity, and usage.<br>

                    <strong>LocalStorage:</strong> localStorage is a client-side storage mechanism that allows you to
                    store key-value
                    pairs in the user's browser. It is used to store data that should be available across multiple
                    browser sessions or tabs. The data stored in localStorage remains even after the browser is closed
                    and reopened. The storage capacity of localStorage is usually larger than that of cookies.<br>

                    <strong>SessionStorage:</strong> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage in terms of usage and
                    syntax, but it is
                    used to store data that should only be available during the current session. The data stored in
                    sessionStorage is cleared when the session ends, i.e., when the user closes the browser or navigates
                    away from the current website. The storage capacity of sessionStorage is usually similar to that of
                    localStorage.<br>

                    <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's browser by the
                    website they are
                    visiting. They are used to store small amounts of data that should be available across multiple
                    browser sessions or tabs. Cookies can be set with an expiration date, after which they are
                    automatically deleted from the user's browser. The storage capacity of cookies is usually smaller
                    than that of localStorage or sessionStorage. <br>
                    
                    <strong>In summary,</strong> localStorage and sessionStorage are client-side storage mechanisms that
                    allow you to
                    store data on the user's browser, while cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's
                    browser by the website they are visiting. LocalStorage is used to store data that should be
                    available across multiple browser sessions, while sessionStorage is used to store data that should
                    only be available during the current session. Cookies are used to store small amounts of data that
                    should be available across multiple browser sessions or tabs.

                    Question-3 : what is EventLoop ?
                </button>
            </h2>
            <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree"

                <div class="accordion-body fs-5">
                    EventLoop is a key concept in JavaScript that refers to the way JavaScript handles asynchronous
                    programming. It is essentially a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle tasks in a non-blocking
                    way, allowing it to handle multiple tasks concurrently and respond to user interactions without
                    blocking the user interface. <br>

                    In JavaScript, the EventLoop is a continuous process that runs in the background, constantly
                    monitoring the call stack and the task queue. When a function is called, it is added to the call
                    stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the call stack. However, when a function encounters
                    an asynchronous operation, such as an HTTP request or a setTimeout() call, it is moved to the task
                    queue rather than being executed immediately. <br>

                    The EventLoop constantly checks the call stack and the task queue, and when the call stack is empty,
                    it retrieves the first task from the task queue and adds it to the call stack. This process
                    continues, with the EventLoop constantly checking the call stack and the task queue, until there are
                    no more tasks in the queue. <br>

                    This mechanism allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently, without blocking the user
                    interface, and respond to user interactions in a timely manner. It is a crucial feature of
                    JavaScript that enables developers to write efficient and responsive code, particularly in web
                    development where user interactions are critical.

                    The quizTimer function takes one argument, dismiss, which is a boolean. It uses this argument to
                    determine whether to clear an interval timer (clearInterval(timer)) and return if dismiss is true.
                    If dismiss is false, it sets an interval timer (setInterval) that executes a function every second.
                    The inner function updates the content of an HTML element with the ID of count by incrementing a
                    count variable and formatting the time in minutes and seconds. It also changes the color of the text
                    every time the count variable goes over 60 seconds.

                    The chooseQuiz function takes two parameters: index, which is the index of the quiz in a larger
                    collection, and givenAns, which is the answer provided by the user. The function checks if the quiz
                    has already been answered and updates the user's answer if it has. If not, it adds the quiz and the
                    answer to the answers array. Then it calls the displayAnswers function. <br>

                    The displayAnswers function takes one parameter: data, an array of the user's answers to the
                    quizzes. The function generates a set of HTML elements that displays the quiz questions, the given
                    answer, and the correct answer for each quiz. It returns a string of generated HTML code.
