                    The main difference between map, filter, forEach, and find in JavaScript is the way they operate on
                    arrays.

                    map: The map method creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element of the
                    original array. The callback function returns a new value that will be used as the corresponding
                    element in the new array.

                    filter: The filter method creates a new array with all the elements from the original array that
                    satisfy a condition specified by a callback function. The callback function must return a boolean
                    value indicating whether the element should be included in the new array.

                    forEach: The forEach method simply iterates over each element of the array and applies a callback
                    function to it. It does not create a new array, nor does it modify the original array.

                    find: The find method returns the first element of the array that satisfies a condition specified by
                    a callback function. The callback function must return a boolean value indicating whether the
                    element satisfies the condition.

                    In summary, map and filter create new arrays, forEach simply iterates over the array, and find
                    returns the first element that satisfies a condition.

                    LocalStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are all client-side storage mechanisms in web development,
                    but they differ in their scope, capacity, and usage.<br>

                    <strong>LocalStorage:</strong> localStorage is a client-side storage mechanism that allows you to
                    store key-value
                    pairs in the user's browser. It is used to store data that should be available across multiple
                    browser sessions or tabs. The data stored in localStorage remains even after the browser is closed
                    and reopened. The storage capacity of localStorage is usually larger than that of cookies.<br>

                    <strong>SessionStorage:</strong> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage in terms of usage and
                    syntax, but it is
                    used to store data that should only be available during the current session. The data stored in
                    sessionStorage is cleared when the session ends, i.e., when the user closes the browser or navigates
                    away from the current website. The storage capacity of sessionStorage is usually similar to that of
                    localStorage.<br>

                    <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's browser by the
                    website they are
                    visiting. They are used to store small amounts of data that should be available across multiple
                    browser sessions or tabs. Cookies can be set with an expiration date, after which they are
                    automatically deleted from the user's browser. The storage capacity of cookies is usually smaller
                    than that of localStorage or sessionStorage. <br>

                    In summary, localStorage and sessionStorage are client-side storage mechanisms that allow you to
                    store data on the user's browser, while cookies are small text files that are stored on the user's
                    browser by the website they are visiting. LocalStorage is used to store data that should be
                    available across multiple browser sessions, while sessionStorage is used to store data that should
                    only be available during the current session. Cookies are used to store small amounts of data that
                    should be available across multiple browser sessions or tabs.

                    Question-3 : what is EventLoop ?
                </button>
            </h2>
            <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree"

                <div class="accordion-body fs-5">
                    EventLoop is a key concept in JavaScript that refers to the way JavaScript handles asynchronous
                    programming. It is essentially a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle tasks in a non-blocking
                    way, allowing it to handle multiple tasks concurrently and respond to user interactions without
                    blocking the user interface. <br>

                    In JavaScript, the EventLoop is a continuous process that runs in the background, constantly
                    monitoring the call stack and the task queue. When a function is called, it is added to the call
                    stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the call stack. However, when a function encounters
                    an asynchronous operation, such as an HTTP request or a setTimeout() call, it is moved to the task
                    queue rather than being executed immediately. <br>

                    The EventLoop constantly checks the call stack and the task queue, and when the call stack is empty,
                    it retrieves the first task from the task queue and adds it to the call stack. This process
                    continues, with the EventLoop constantly checking the call stack and the task queue, until there are
                    no more tasks in the queue. <br>

                    This mechanism allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently, without blocking the user
                    interface, and respond to user interactions in a timely manner. It is a crucial feature of
                    JavaScript that enables developers to write efficient and responsive code, particularly in web
                    development where user interactions are critical.

                    used. <br>

                    However, based on its name, it can be assumed that the function is related to selecting a quiz or a
                    set of questions. Depending on the implementation, the ChooseQuiz function may take input from the
                    user to select a specific quiz or it may randomly select a quiz from a list of available quizzes. <br>

                    The ChooseQuiz function may also be responsible for retrieving the selected quiz or set of questions
                    from a database or a file and returning it to the program for further processing. The specific
                    implementation of the ChooseQuiz function will depend on the requirements and the design of the
                    application or program that it is used in.
